## Abandon all hope ye who enter here
Giving up on develping the app down the path of using pip to install the modules directly into the .app . The py2app progam has customized the site.py and a number of other files heavily in a way that makes it impossible to run pip. It may be possible, but I cannot figure out how

## Problems
- USER_BASE not defined in py2app's site.py
- setup-tools are weird
